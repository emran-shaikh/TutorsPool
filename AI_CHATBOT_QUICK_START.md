## üí° How It Works

### With AI (Recommended):
```
User: "I need help with calculus"
AI: "Great! We have excellent calculus tutors available.  
     Our calculus tutoring starts at $25/hour and includes:
     - One-on-one sessions
     - Homework help
     - Exam preparation
     Would you like to browse our calculus tutors?"
```

### Without AI (Fallback):
```
User: "I need help with calculus"
Bot: "We offer tutoring in 50+ subjects including Mathematics..."
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI not initialized" or AI responses not working?

1. **Check if OpenAI package is installed:**
   ```bash
   npm list openai
   ```
   If not found, run: `npm install openai`

2. **Check environment file:**
   - Make sure `.env.local` exists in project root
   - API key is correct (no extra spaces)
   - `AI_PROVIDER` matches your provider

3. **Restart backend server:**
   ```bash
   # Stop server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run server:dev
   ```

4. **Check logs:**
   - Look for: `‚úÖ AI Chat Service initialized with OpenAI`
   - Or: `‚ö†Ô∏è AI Chat Service running in local mode`

### Still not working?

**No problem!** The chatbot will automatically use smart rule-based responses. It still works great without AI.
