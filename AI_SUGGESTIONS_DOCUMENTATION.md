  id: studentProfile.id,
  userId: userId,
  gradeLevel: studentProfile.gradeLevel || 'high-school',
  learningGoals: studentProfile.learningGoals,
  interests: studentProfile.interests || ['general-education'],
  strengths: studentProfile.strengths || ['dedicated'],
  weaknesses: studentProfile.weaknesses || ['time-management'],
  careerGoals: studentProfile.careerGoals || ['professional-development'],
  sessionHistory: {
    totalSessions: completedBookings.length,
    preferredSubjects: subjectsStudied,

2. **Grade Appropriateness**: Filters subjects by academic level
3. **Career Alignment**: Matches subjects to career goals
4. **Weakness Improvement**: Suggests subjects to strengthen weak areas
5. **Deduplication**: Removes duplicates and calculates confidence scores
6. **Ranking**: Sorts by confidence and relevance

### **3. Suggestion Generation**
```typescript
const suggestions = [
  {
    subject: 'computer-science',
    confidence: 0.85,
    reason: 'Based on your interest in technology',
    difficulty: 'INTERMEDIATE',
    estimatedHours: 150,
    prerequisites: ['mathematics'],
    relatedSubjects: ['mathematics', 'engineering', 'data-science'],
    careerRelevance: ['software-development', 'data-science'],
    learningPath: ['programming', 'algorithms', 'data-structures']
  }
