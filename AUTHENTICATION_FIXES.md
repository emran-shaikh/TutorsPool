# Authentication Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Student Registration Form
**Problem:** Step 2 validation was failing because `preferredMode` field was shown in the UI but validated in step 3 schema.

**Fix:**
- Moved `preferredMode` validation from step 3 to step 2 in the `stepSchemas` object
- Updated the `nextStep` validation logic to include `preferredMode` in step 2 data

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/forms/StudentRegistrationForm.tsx`

### 2. Tutor Registration Form
**Problem:** 
- Subjects and levels were not properly updating when toggled
- Hourly rate validation was converting to cents prematurely during step validation

**Fix:**
- Fixed `toggleSubject` and `toggleLevel` functions to properly update both state and form values
- Changed validation to use `selectedSubjects` and `selectedLevels` state instead of `watchedValues`
- Removed premature cents conversion during step validation (conversion happens on final submit)
- Removed `int()` constraint from hourlyRateCents in step 3 schema since input is in dollars

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/forms/TutorRegistrationForm.tsx`

### 3. Sign Up Page Navigation
**Problem:** "Sign in here" link on the signup page was not navigating to the login page.

**Fix:**
- Added `onClick` handler to navigate to `/login` page

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/SignUp.tsx`

## Server Status
- Backend API: http://localhost:5174
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Both servers are running via `npm run dev:all`

## Authentication Flow
1. User fills registration form
2. Frontend calls `registerUser()` from AuthContext
3. AuthContext calls `apiClient.register()` which sends POST to `/api/auth/register`
4. Server creates user in dataManager and returns JWT token
5. Token is stored in localStorage
6. For student/tutor, additional profile creation API is called
7. User is redirected to role-based dashboard

## Known Limitations
- Password validation is currently minimal (no actual password storage)
- Email verification is not implemented
- Admin code is hardcoded (ADMIN2024)
- File uploads are stored as blob URLs (not persisted to cloud storage)

## Next Steps
1. Test all registration flows end-to-end
2. Verify login works with registered users
3. Check dashboard redirects are working correctly
4. Test role-based access control
