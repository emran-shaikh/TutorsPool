## 🚨 Known Issues & Limitations

### Test Environment Limitations
1. **JSDOM**: Cannot fully test browser security features
   - Recommendation: Use Playwright for E2E security tests

2. **Firebase Mocking**: Some Firebase features mocked
   - Recommendation: Test with Firebase emulator

3. **Network Requests**: Mocked fetch responses
   - Recommendation: Test against real API in staging

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Add Playwright E2E security tests
- [ ] Implement rate limiting tests
- [ ] Add CAPTCHA testing
- [ ] Test 2FA implementation
- [ ] Add penetration testing
- [ ] Implement security scanning (OWASP ZAP)
