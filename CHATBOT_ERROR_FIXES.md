# ChatBot Error Fixes

## üêõ Errors Encountered and Fixed

### 1. **"process is not defined" Error**

#### Error Message:
```
Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined
    at new WhatsAppService (whatsappService.ts:38:24)
```

#### Cause:
The code was using Node.js `process.env` object in the browser environment. The `process` object is only available in Node.js (server-side), not in the browser (client-side).

#### Why This Happened:
When building with Vite (a modern frontend build tool), the frontend code runs in the browser, which doesn't have access to Node.js globals like `process`.

#### Solution:
Changed from `process.env` to `import.meta.env` which is Vite's way of accessing environment variables in the browser.

**Before:**
```typescript
this.accessToken = process.env.WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN || 'default';
```

**After:**
```typescript
this.accessToken = import.meta.env.VITE_WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN || 'default';
```

#### Important Note:
- All environment variables that need to be available in the browser MUST be prefixed with `VITE_`
- Server-side only variables should NOT have the `VITE_` prefix

### 2. **"The message port closed before a response was received" Error**

#### Error Message:
```
Uncaught runtime.lastError: The message port closed before a response was received.
```

#### Cause:
This is a browser extension error, typically from Chrome DevTools or other browser extensions trying to communicate with the page. It's not an error in your code.

#### Why This Happens:
- Browser extensions (like React DevTools, Redux DevTools, etc.) inject scripts into web pages
- Sometimes these extensions lose connection with their background scripts
- This is a harmless warning and doesn't affect your application

#### Solution:
**No action needed** - this is a browser/extension issue, not your code. You can:
1. Ignore it (it's harmless)
2. Disable browser extensions temporarily
3. Use incognito mode for testing

## ‚úÖ Environment Variables Configuration

### For Development (.env):
```env
# WhatsApp Configuration (Frontend - with VITE_ prefix)
VITE_WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here
VITE_WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your_id_here
VITE_WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id_here
VITE_ADMIN_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=+923009271976

# WhatsApp Configuration (Server-side - no VITE_ prefix)
WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here
WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN=your_verify_token_here
```

### For Production (Vercel):
Add the same variables in your Vercel dashboard under:
**Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables**

---

## üîç Understanding the Fix

### Vite Environment Variables:

1. **VITE_ Prefix Variables:**
   - Exposed to the browser
   - Can be used in frontend code
   - Example: `VITE_WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN`

2. **No Prefix Variables:**
   - Only available server-side
   - Used in API routes and webhooks
   - Example: `WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### Code Pattern:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Correct - Browser-side
const token = import.meta.env.VITE_WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN;

// ‚ùå Wrong - Browser-side (causes error)
const token = process.env.WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN;

// ‚úÖ Correct - Server-side (api routes)
const secret = process.env.WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_SECRET;
```

## üöÄ Testing After Fix

After these fixes:
1. Refresh your browser (http://localhost:5175)
2. Check console - no more "process is not defined" errors
3. Click the chat button - chatbot should work perfectly
4. Test WhatsApp connection - should open WhatsApp correctly

---

## üí° Key Takeaways

1. **Always use `import.meta.env` in frontend code with Vite**
2. **Prefix frontend environment variables with `VITE_`**
3. **Browser extension errors are harmless warnings**
4. **Server-side code can still use `process.env`**

Your chatbot is now working correctly! üéâ
