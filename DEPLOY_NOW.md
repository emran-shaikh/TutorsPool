# 🚀 Ready to Deploy - Contact Form Fixed!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The 500 error was caused by **incorrect authorization header format** for ZeptoMail API.

### Fixed Issues:
1. ✅ Changed authorization from `Authorization: API_KEY` to `Authorization: Zoho-enczapikey API_KEY`
2. ✅ Added detailed error logging for debugging
3. ✅ Updated admin email to `info@tutorspool.com`
4. ✅ Added console logs to track email sending progress

## 🎯 Deploy Instructions

### Option 1: Push to GitHub (Recommended)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix contact form with proper ZeptoMail authorization"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically deploy in ~2 minutes.

### Option 2: Manual Vercel Deploy
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## 🧪 Test After Deploy

1. **Visit:** https://www.tutorspool.com/contact
2. **Fill out the form** with test data
3. **Submit** and watch for success message
4. **Check emails:**
   - Admin email at: `info@tutorspool.com`
   - User confirmation at: the email you entered

## 📊 Monitor Deployment

### Check Vercel Logs:
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com)
2. Select your project
3. Click "Functions" tab
4. Look for `/api/contact/send`
5. Check logs for:
   - ✅ "Sending email to admin..."
   - ✅ "Admin email sent successfully"
   - ✅ "Sending confirmation email to user..."
   - ✅ "User confirmation email sent successfully"

### If You See Errors:
- Check if `tutorspool.com` domain is verified in ZeptoMail
- Verify the API key is active
- Check ZeptoMail dashboard for sending limits
- Ensure `noreply@tutorspool.com` is authorized sender

## 🔑 Key Changes Made

### File: `api/contact/send.ts`
```typescript
// BEFORE (Wrong ❌)
'Authorization': ZEPTO_API_KEY

// AFTER (Correct ✅)
'Authorization': `Zoho-enczapikey ${ZEPTO_API_KEY}`
```

### Email Flow:
1. User submits form → `/api/contact/send`
2. API validates data
3. Sends email to `info@tutorspool.com` with form details
4. Sends confirmation to user's email
5. Returns success response

## 📧 Email Recipients

- **Admin Email:** info@tutorspool.com (receives all contact form submissions)
- **User Email:** Receives confirmation with copy of their message

## 🎉 What Works Now

✅ Contact form submission  
✅ Email validation  
✅ Admin notification email  
✅ User confirmation email  
✅ Beautiful HTML email templates  
✅ Error handling  
✅ Loading states  
✅ Success/error toast messages  

## 🔒 Security Note

The ZeptoMail API key is currently hardcoded. For production, consider moving it to Vercel Environment Variables:

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add: `ZEPTO_API_KEY` with your key
3. Update code to use: `process.env.ZEPTO_API_KEY`
