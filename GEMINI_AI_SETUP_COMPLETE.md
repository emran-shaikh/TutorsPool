**Solution:**
1. Check `.env.local` file exists in project root

3. Restart backend: `npm run server:dev`

### "Cannot find package @google/generative-ai"?
**Solution:**
```bash
npm install @google/generative-ai
```

### Slow responses?

- Still works great without AI
- Check console for specific error messages
