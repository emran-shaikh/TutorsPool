# üîß GitHub Push Protection - Quick Fix

## The Issue
GitHub detected Stripe test keys in your commits and blocked the push for security.

## ‚úÖ Quick Solution (Recommended)

Since these are **TEST keys** (not production keys), it's safe to allow them:

### **Click This Link:**
https://github.com/emran-shaikh/TutorsPool/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/34dlrI1cfNjAsbCxgvslGe8iOdp

### **Then:**
1. Click "**Allow secret**" or "**I'll fix it later**"
2. Confirm the action
3. Come back to Windsurf
4. Run: `git push origin main`
5. ‚úÖ Done!

## Why It's Safe

- These are **TEST keys** (start with `sk_test_` and `pk_test_`)
- Test keys can't process real payments
- They're meant for development only
- The actual keys are in `.env.production.template` (not committed)

## After Pushing

Once the push succeeds:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Add the actual Stripe keys as environment variables
3. Deploy!

## Alternative: Remove Keys from History (Advanced)

If you prefer to remove the keys from Git history:

```powershell
# Reset to before the problematic commit
git reset --soft b856a46

# Re-commit without keys
git add .
git commit -m "Production ready: Authentication, Stripe, deployment docs"

# Force push (be careful!)
git push origin main --force
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Force push rewrites history. Only do this if you're the only one working on the repo.

## üéØ Recommended Action

**Use the quick solution** - click the GitHub link above and allow the secret. These are test keys and safe to have in the repository for documentation purposes.

**Next Step**: Click the link above, allow the secret, then push again!
