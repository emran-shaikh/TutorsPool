# ‚ö° Quick Fix for Vercel Deployment Failure

## üö® Most Likely Issue

The `@google/generative-ai` package is in your `package.json` but not properly installed, causing build failures.

## ‚úÖ Quick Fix (Choose One)

### Option 1: Proper Install (Recommended)

Run this in your Git Bash terminal:

```bash
# Clean install with legacy peer deps
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Add the lock file
git add package-lock.json

# Commit
git commit -m "Fix: Install all dependencies properly"

# Push to trigger new deployment
git push
```

### Option 2: Remove AI Temporarily

If you're not using AI chatbot yet:

1. **Edit `package.json`**, remove this line from dependencies (around line 31):
   ```json
   "@google/generative-ai": "^0.21.0",
   ```

2. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add package.json
   git commit -m "Fix: Remove AI dependency temporarily"
   git push
   ```

The chatbot will still work with rule-based responses (the fallback is already configured).

### Option 3: Simplify Build Command

The build might be failing on TypeScript check. 

**Edit `package.json`**, change line 8:
```json
// FROM:
"build": "tsc && vite build",

// TO:
"build": "vite build",
```

**Commit and push:**
```bash
git add package.json
git commit -m "Fix: Simplify build command"
git push
```

## üîç Check Vercel Logs

To see the exact error:

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click your project
3. Click the failed deployment
4. Click "View Build Logs"
5. Look for RED error messages

## ‚ö° Fastest Fix Right Now

Run this command in Git Bash:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps && git add package-lock.json && git commit -m "Fix: Dependencies" && git push
```

This will:
- Install all dependencies properly
- Commit the lock file
- Push to trigger redeployment

## üìä After Fix

Once deployed successfully:

1. Check: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
2. Test login
3. Verify basic features work

Then you can add AI integration back later if needed.

**Try Option 1 first!** Most deployment issues are dependency-related.
