# 🔧 Complete Routing Fix & End-to-End Test Guide

## 🎯 Issue Summary
Routing not working on Vercel production - users getting 404 errors when accessing pages directly or refreshing.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Simplified `vercel.json`
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Added `public/_redirects` (backup)
```
/api/* /api/:splat 200
/* /index.html 200
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Still Getting 404 on Refresh
**Solution:**
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify `vercel.json` is in root directory
3. Ensure build completed successfully
4. Try clearing browser cache
5. Check if `dist/index.html` exists in build output

### Issue 2: Redirects Not Working After Login
**Check:**
- `AuthContext.tsx` - `getDashboardUrl()` function
- `Login.tsx` - redirect logic after successful login
- `ProtectedRoute.tsx` - role-based redirects
- Browser console for errors

### Issue 3: Dashboard Shows 404
**Check:**
- Route is defined in `App.tsx`
- Component is imported correctly
- Protected route wrapper is correct
- User role matches required role

### Issue 4: Navigation Links Don't Work
**Check:**
- Using `<Link>` from `react-router-dom` (not `<a>`)
- Links have correct `to` prop
- Router is properly configured
- No JavaScript errors in console
